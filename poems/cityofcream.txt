City of Cream
Anahita Shukla
sweetheart, the lover calls beneath a window.
prayer, the muâ€™addhin calls before the dawn.

light bathes the heart.
pomegranate cheeks blush.
the cat goes walking in the alleys.
morning breaks like the sugar cube
between teeth, soft and sweet,
a rosewater cardamom melt.

slowly all quarters of the city rise.
slowly the women begin to laugh.
