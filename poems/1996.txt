Rabindranath Tagore
Who are you reading curiously this poem of mine
A hundred years from now?
Shall I be able to send to you
-Steeped in the love of my heart-
The faintest touch of this spring morning’s joy,
The scent of a flower,
A bird-song’s note,
A spark of today’s blaze of color,
A hundred years from now?

Yet, for once, open your window on the south
And from your balcony
Gaze at the far horizon.
Then, sinking deep in fancy
Think of the ecstasies of joy
That came floating down
From some far heaven of bliss
To touch the heart of the world
A hundred years ago;
Think of the young spring day
Wild, impetuous and free,
And of the south wind
-Fragrant with the pollen of flowers-
Rushing on restless wings to paint the earth
With the radiant hues of youth
A hundred years before your day.

And think, how his heart aflame,
His whole being rapt in song,
A poet was awake that day
To unfold like flowers
His myriad thoughts
With what wealth of love!-
One morning a hundred years ago.

A hundred years from now
Who is the new poet singing his songs to you?
Across the years I send him
The joyous greeting of this spring.
May my song echo for a while,
On your spring day,
In the beating of your heart,
In the murmur of bees,
In the rustling of leaves,-
A hundred years from today.
