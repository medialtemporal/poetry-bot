El Desdichado
Gérard de Nerval, tr. Lawrence Rainey
I am the man of gloom,—the widower,—the unconsoled,
The Prince of Aquitania, his tower in ruins:
My only star is dead, and my constellated lute
Bears the Black Sun of Melancholia.
In the night of the tomb, you who’ve consoled me,
Give me back Posillipo and the Italian sea,
The flower that so pleased my desolate heart,
And the arbor where the vine and rose are intertwined.
Am I Amor or Phoebus? … Lusignan or Biron?
My brow still burns from the kiss of the queen;
I have dreamed in the grotto where the siren swims…
And twice I have crossed Acheron victorious:
Modulating on the lyre of Orpheus
Now the sighs of the saint, now the cry of the fairy.
